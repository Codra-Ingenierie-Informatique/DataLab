msgstr ""

#: ../../../CHANGELOG.md:18
msgid ""
"ROI extraction was not working properly when the \"Extract all regions of"
" interest into a single image object\" option was enabled if there was "
"only one defined ROI. The result was an image positioned at the origin "
"(0, 0) instead of the expected position (x0, y0) and the ROI rectangle "
"itself was not removed as expected. This is now fixed (see [Issue "

"Before, DataLab was showing an error message when trying to save "

"When installing DataLab on Windows from a non-administrator account, the "
