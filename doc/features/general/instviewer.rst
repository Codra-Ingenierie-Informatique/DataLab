About CobraDataLab installation
===============================

Because of the multiple ways of installing CobraDataLab on your machine,
understanding why the application behaves unexpectedly without any
information on your configuration could be very challenging.

That is why CobraDataLab provides the dialog box "About CobraDataLab installation".

    About your CobraDataLab installation (see "?" menu)

Reporting unexpected behavior or any other bug on `GitHub Issues`_
will be greatly appreciated, especially if above contents are attached
to the report (as well log files, see :ref:`ref-to-logviewer`).
