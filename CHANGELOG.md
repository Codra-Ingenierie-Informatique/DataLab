for future and past milestones.

## DataLab Version 0.9.2 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Region of interest (ROI) extraction feature for images:
  * ROI extraction was not working properly when the "Extract all regions of interest
    into a single image object" option was enabled if there was only one defined ROI.
    The result was an image positioned at the origin (0, 0) instead of the expected
    position (x0, y0) and the ROI rectangle itself was not removed as expected.
    This is now fixed (see [Issue #6](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/6) - 'Extract multiple ROI' feature: unexpected result for a single ROI)
  * ROI extraction was not taking into account the pixel size (dx, dy) and the origin
    (x0, y0) of the image.
    This is now fixed (see [Issue #8](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/8) - Image ROI extraction: take into account pixel size)
* Macro-command console is now read-only:
  * The macro-command panel Python console is currently not supporting standard input
    stream (`stdin`) and this is intended (at least for now)
  * Set Python console read-only to avoid confusion

## DataLab Version 0.9.1 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* French translation is not available on Windows/Stand alone version:
  * Locale was not properly detected on Windows for stand-alone version (frozen
    with `pyinstaller`) due to an issue with `locale.getlocale()` (function
    returning `None` instead of the expected locale on frozen applications)
  * This is ultimately a `pyinstaller` issue, but a workaround has been
    implemented in `guidata` V3.2.2 (see [guidata issue #68](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/68) - Windows: gettext translation is not working on frozen applications)
  * [Issue #2](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/2) - French translation is not available on Windows Stand alone version
* Saving image to JPEG2000 fails for non integer data:
  * JPEG2000 encoder does not support non integer data or signed integer data
  * Before, DataLab was showing an error message when trying to save incompatible
    data to JPEG2000: this was not a consistent behavior with other standard image
    formats (e.g. PNG, JPG, etc.) for which DataLab was automatically converting
    data to the appropriate format (8-bit unsigned integer)
  * Current behavior is now consistent with other standard image formats: when
    saving to JPEG2000, DataLab automatically converts data to 8-bit unsigned
    integer or 16-bit unsigned integer (depending on the original data type)
  * [Issue #3](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/3) - Save image to JPEG2000: 'OSError: encoder error -2 when writing image file'
* Windows stand-alone version shortcuts not showing in current user start menu:
  * When installing DataLab on Windows from a non-administrator account, the
    shortcuts were not showing in the current user start menu but in the
    administrator start menu instead (due to the elevated privileges of the
    installer and the fact that the installer does not support installing
    shortcuts for all users)
  * Now, the installer *does not* ask for elevated privileges anymore, and
    shortcuts are installed in the current user start menu (this also means that
    the current user must have write access to the installation directory)
  * In future releases, the installer will support installing shortcuts for all
    users if there is a demand for it (see [Issue #5](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/5))
  * [Issue #4](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/4) - Windows: stand-alone version shortcuts not showing in current user start menu
* Installation and configuration window for stand-alone version:
  * Do not show ambiguous error message 'Invalid dependencies' anymore
  * Dependencies are supposed to be checked when building the stand-alone version
* Added PDF documentation to stand-alone version:
  * The PDF documentation was missing in previous release
  * Now, the PDF documentation (in English and French) is included in the
    stand-alone version

  images) from current view.

* Added an option "hide_on_close" to CDLMainWindow class constructor
  (default value is False): when set to True, DataLab main window will simply
  hide when "Close" button is clicked, which is the expected behavior when
  embedding DataLab in another application.

Bug fixes:

* The memory leak fix in app.py was accidentally commented before commit.

### CodraFT Version 1.2.1 ###

Bug fixes:

* When quitting DataLab, objects were not deleted: this was causing a memory
  leak when embedding DataLab in another Qt window.

* When canceling HDF5 import dialog box after selecting at least one signal or
  image, the progress bar was shown even if no data was being imported.

* When closing HDF5 import dialog box, preview signal/image widgets were not
  deleted, hence causing another memory leak.

### CodraFT Version 1.2.0 ###

New features:

* Added support for uint32 images (converting to int32 data)

* Added "Z-axis logarithmic scale" feature for image items (check out the new
  entries in standard image toolbar and context menu)

  between HDF5 I/O icons and Signal/Image specific I/O icons (i.e. open and
  save actions)

* Cross-section panels are now configured to show only cross-section curves
  associated to the currently selected image (instead of showing all curves,
  including those associated to hidden images)

* Image subtraction: now handling integer underflow

Bug fixes:

* When "Clean up data view" option was enabled, image histogram was not updated
  properly when changing image selection (histogram was the sum of all images
  histograms).

* Changed default image levels histogram "eliminate outliers" value: .1% instead
  of 2% to avoid display bug for noise background images for example (i.e.
  images with high contrast and very narrow histogram levels)

### CodraFT Version 1.1.2 ###

Bug fixes:

* When the X/Y Cross Section widget is embedded into a main window other than
  DataLab's, clicking on the "Process signal" button will send the signal to
  DataLab's signal panel for further processing, as expected.

### CodraFT Version 1.1.1 ###

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug leading to "None" titles when importing signals/images from HDF5
  files created outside DataLab.

New features:

* Added new icons.

* Images:

  * Added support for SPIRICON image files (single-frame support only).

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a critical bug when opening HDF5 file (bug from "guidata" package).
  Now guidata is patched inside DataLab to take into account the unusual/risky
  PyQt patch from Taurus package (PyQt API is set to 2 for QString objects and
  instead of raising an ImportError when importing QString from PyQt4.QtCore,
  QString still exists and is replaced by "str"...).

* Images:

  * Centroid feature: coordinates were mixed up in DataLab application.

* Signals:

  * Curve fitting (gaussian and lorentzian): fixed amplitude initial value
      for automatic fitting feature
  * FWHM and FW1/e¬≤: fixed amplitude computation for input fit parameters
      and output results

  * Added support for images containing NaN values.

* Signals:

  * Added FWHM computing feature (based on curve fitting)
  * Added Full Width at 1/e¬≤ computing feature (based on gaussian fitting)
  * Added derivative and integral computation features.
  * Added "lorentzian" and "Voigt" to "new signals" available.

* Added curve fitting feature supporting various models (polynomial,
  gaussian, lorentzian, Voigt and multi-gaussian). Computed fitting
  parameters are stored in signal's metadata (a new dictionary item
  for the Signal objects)

* Edit menu: added a new "View in a new window" action

* Added standard keyboard shortcuts (new, open, copy, etc.)

* "New image": added new 2D-gaussian creation feature

* Added a GUI-based ROI extraction feature for both signal and image views

* Added a pop-up dialog when double-clicking on a signal/image to allow
  visualizing things on a possibly large window

* Added a peak detection feature

* Added centroid coordinates in image statistics tool

* Added support for curve/image titles, axis labels and axis units (those can
  be modified through the editable form within the "Properties" groupbox)

* Added support for cross section extraction from the image widget to the
  signal tab ; the extracted curve's title shows the associated coordinates

* Added deployment script for building self-consistent executable distribution
  using the cx_Freeze tool

* Improved curve visual: background is now flat and white

Bug fixes:

* Console dockwidget is now created after the `View` menu so that it appears
  in it, as expected. It is now hidden by default.

* Improved curve visual when selected: instead of adding big black squares
  along a selected curve, the curve line is simply broader when selected.
