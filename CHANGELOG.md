for future and past milestones.

## DataLab Version 0.9.3 ##

üí• New features:

* Features common to signals and images:
  * Added "Real part" and "Imaginary part" features to "Operation" menu

## DataLab Version 0.9.2 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Region of interest (ROI) extraction feature for images:
  * ROI extraction was not working properly when the "Extract all regions of interest
    into a single image object" option was enabled if there was only one defined ROI.
    The result was an image positioned at the origin (0, 0) instead of the expected
    position (x0, y0) and the ROI rectangle itself was not removed as expected.
    This is now fixed (see [Issue #6](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/6) - 'Extract multiple ROI' feature: unexpected result for a single ROI)
  * ROI rectangles with negative coordinates were not properly handled:
    ROI extraction was raising a `ValueError` exception, and the image mask was not
    displayed properly.
    This is now fixed (see [Issue #7](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/7) - Image ROI extraction: `ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation minimum which has no identity`)
  * ROI extraction was not taking into account the pixel size (dx, dy) and the origin
    (x0, y0) of the image.
    This is now fixed (see [Issue #8](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/8) - Image ROI extraction: take into account pixel size)
* Macro-command console is now read-only:
  * The macro-command panel Python console is currently not supporting standard input
    stream (`stdin`) and this is intended (at least for now)
  * Set Python console read-only to avoid confusion

## DataLab Version 0.9.1 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* French translation is not available on Windows/Stand alone version:
  * Locale was not properly detected on Windows for stand-alone version (frozen
    with `pyinstaller`) due to an issue with `locale.getlocale()` (function
    returning `None` instead of the expected locale on frozen applications)
  * This is ultimately a `pyinstaller` issue, but a workaround has been
    implemented in `guidata` V3.2.2 (see [guidata issue #68](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/68) - Windows: gettext translation is not working on frozen applications)
  * [Issue #2](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/2) - French translation is not available on Windows Stand alone version
* Saving image to JPEG2000 fails for non integer data:
  * JPEG2000 encoder does not support non integer data or signed integer data
  * Before, DataLab was showing an error message when trying to save incompatible
    data to JPEG2000: this was not a consistent behavior with other standard image
    formats (e.g. PNG, JPG, etc.) for which DataLab was automatically converting
    data to the appropriate format (8-bit unsigned integer)
  * Current behavior is now consistent with other standard image formats: when
    saving to JPEG2000, DataLab automatically converts data to 8-bit unsigned
    integer or 16-bit unsigned integer (depending on the original data type)
  * [Issue #3](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/3) - Save image to JPEG2000: 'OSError: encoder error -2 when writing image file'
* Windows stand-alone version shortcuts not showing in current user start menu:
  * When installing DataLab on Windows from a non-administrator account, the
    shortcuts were not showing in the current user start menu but in the
    administrator start menu instead (due to the elevated privileges of the
    installer and the fact that the installer does not support installing
    shortcuts for all users)
  * Now, the installer *does not* ask for elevated privileges anymore, and
    shortcuts are installed in the current user start menu (this also means that
    the current user must have write access to the installation directory)
  * In future releases, the installer will support installing shortcuts for all
    users if there is a demand for it (see [Issue #5](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/5))
  * [Issue #4](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/issues/4) - Windows: stand-alone version shortcuts not showing in current user start menu
* Installation and configuration window for stand-alone version:
  * Do not show ambiguous error message 'Invalid dependencies' anymore
  * Dependencies are supposed to be checked when building the stand-alone version
* Added PDF documentation to stand-alone version:
  * The PDF documentation was missing in previous release
  * Now, the PDF documentation (in English and French) is included in the
    stand-alone version

## DataLab Version 0.9.0 ##

New dependencies:

* DataLab is now powered by [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack):
  * [PythonQwt](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/PythonQwt)
  * [guidata](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata)
  * [PlotPy](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/PlotPy)
* [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) (algorithms for image processing)

New reference platform:

* DataLab is validated on Windows 11 with Python 3.11 and PyQt 5.15
* DataLab is also compatible with other OS (Linux, MacOS) and other Python-Qt
  bindings and versions (Python 3.8-3.12, PyQt6, PySide6)

New features:

* DataLab is a platform:

      features for signals and images
    * Custom HDF5 features: new HDF5 file formats can be added to the standard
      HDF5 import feature
    * More features to come...
